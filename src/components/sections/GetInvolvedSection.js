          <P>
            The way our active members become active members is usually, “show
            up to meetings, then take on work.” We have a variety of meetings
            every month: each of them should include opportunities for members
            to dig into ongoing projects, (And if they don’t, feel free to email
            <a href="mailto:newmember@ebdsa.org">newmember@ebdsa.org</a> with
            feedback or questions.) If you’re not sure how or where to get
            involved, you’ll find suggestions in this section, and you can also
            check out the directories at the end of this document.

            We think of all DSA members as socialist organizers (that’s what it
            says on your membership card!), but at the same time we know that
            almost no one comes to DSA a fully formed socialist organizer.
          </P>
          <P>
            Organizing requires us all to develop a variety of skills: being
            able to map out a social group, identifying natural leaders,
            figuring out what people need to hear in order to bring their best,
            and making courageous asks. These are skills you can apply inside
            the organization as you get your feet under you, but also outside of
            it: figuring out what friends to invite to which events, testing
            which appeals work on Your Uncle at Thanksgiving, and otherwise
            advancing socialism through honest conversations.
          </P>
          <P>
            Organizing also requires practical skills like being reliable,
            organized, and communicative about your limits and your
            availability.
          </P>
          <P>
            That said, here are some easy ways in! If you’re ever not sure or
            have questions, email{" "}

            Our District Canvass teams meet once a month to go door-to-door in
            their neighborhoods and bring in new supporters for socialist
            campaigns like national Medicare-for-All or the efforts for
            single-payer in California.

            More than just knocking-and-talking, a good canvass will break down
            barriers between you and your neighbors and make space for
            meaningful conversations about the issues that materially affect our
            lives. No experience is necessary: canvassing training is provided
            every time, and you always canvass with a partner.

              There is a spectre haunting NorCal: the spectre of flakiness.
              People say “we should meet up!” and never follow through.
              Good-sounding ideas are tossed around without serious
              consideration of what it would take to make them happen. (And
              let’s not even TALK about online dating.) This is, undoubtedly, a
              consequence of living in a society where we’re taught to be
              consumers instead of a community, and where the prevailing ethos
              is “you don’t owe anyone anything.” We’ve all been guilty of this,
              at one point or another, but if we are going to seriously build a
              structure strong enough to remake the world, we need to show up on
              time for meetings.

              In this organization, what you do matters. We might be socially
              conditioned to window-shop every single possible choice until the
              last minute, but that doesn’t foster a strong organization. Commit
              to something, and hold to it. We’re not asking you to martyr
              yourself, because that’s how burnout happens. Don’t take on more
              than you can sustain. We also recognize that not everyone has a
              few extra hours per week, because capitalism is awful. Just do
              what you can. You’re not going to get fired or yelled at if you
              get overwhelmed or drop the ball every once in awhile. But when
              you honor people’s time and energy, you build trust.{" "}

            These District Canvass teams are coordinated by our External
            Organizing Committee, which meets the last Tuesday of every month to
            bring new organizers into our public-facing political campaigns.
            Specific canvass dates are always posted on eastbaydsa.org and
            usually mirrored on the chapter Facebook events page.

            The monthly <Strong>No-Work Picnic</Strong> happens on the last

            <Strong>just start doing it</Strong>. Our movement gets stronger
            when we have a strong body of activities that stitch us together
            alongside the work. (Internal Organizers might still be able to
            point you out to people with similar interests, but you don’t need
            anyone’s permission.)

            If you have an idea for <Strong>something more official</Strong>,
            like putting together an Earthquake Preparedness Plan, coordinating
            an event with another local organization, or tabling at the Coliseum
            BART stop on game days, it helps to be plugged in. Find the
            committee (or caucus) doing the organizing closest to your idea, get
            involved with their ongoing work, and once you have the lay of the
            land, ask some of the organizers to talk it over with you. The more
            you can take on the logistical work surrounding your idea (and round
            up previously inactive members or interested non-members to help),
            the more likely you are to make it happen quickly.

            If you want to gather folks together in self-organizing but ongoing

          <SideBar title="Forming a caucus" style="red">
            Caucuses are independent formations of members within the Local.
            They’re a big part of internal democracy. If you think we need to do
            more on a particular front, if you want to gather people who are
            interested in the same issues or shared experiences, or if you want
            to push the leadership to consider alternatives to the current path,
            a caucus might be what you’re looking for. Local caucuses have
            formed around socialist feminism, environmental justice, social
            housing, and the abolition of prisons and policing. (The website
            should always have an up-to-date list of formally recognized
            caucuses.) We also have caucuses with more subtle missions, like the
            Craft Caucus. Any member can form a caucus, for any reason. If you
            want your caucus to be officially recognized (which means you get
            listed on the website) you’ll need to get together five members and
            a statement that includes the name and purpose of the caucus, and
            send it to the Local Secretary.

            While we encourage self-organizing, there are still a couple of
            things where it’s important to get approval from the larger body of
            the membership (or their elected representatives).
          </P>
          <P>
            <Strong>ELECTORAL ENDORSEMENTS:</Strong> You can feel free to get
            involved in a campaign as an individual, but the big-tent nature of
            our org makes it important that the collective membership gets to
            vote on it before someone starts claiming a DSA endorsement.
            Official endorsements require a full meeting and vote of the general
            mem- bership (or in fast-moving and/ or emergency circumstances, a
            three-quarters vote from the Local Council.)
          </P>
          <P>
            <Strong>SPEAKING FOR THE GROUP:</Strong> Be mindful of when you’re
            representing the org and when you’re speaking as an individual. This
            isn’t a hard and fast rule, but basically, if you’re in
            communication with another organization, a business, or the press,
            feel free to mention you’re a member and speak your mind. There’s no
            muzzle here. Just make it clear you’re not speaking on behalf of the
            organization until you’re sure it’s a position approved by a
            democratic process. The Local Council approves official chapter
            representatives for the purposes of interacting with other
            organizations or within a coalition space. Local Council and general
            membership meetings vote to approve positions, events, and
            strategies for the chapter; any work done by caucuses or ad hoc
            members should be presented as such.

              STARTING A MAJOR NEW PROJECT OR FORMING AN OFFICIAL WORKING GROUP:
            </Strong>{" "}
            We want to build institutional memory and coordinated effort, so we
            don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time we want to print up
            flyers or get T-shirts made.
          </P>
          <P>
            What this means in practice is that we focus our all-important
            resources of member time and energy on democratically determined
            priorities, building expertise in the standing committees and
            project teams, while committee member conversations and caucus
            meetings act as laboratories for new projects and initiatives.

            If you’ve gotten involved with the IOC or EOC and find that there is
            a specific need that is not being met by existing teams, you can
            talk to an Organizer about your ideas and work together to develop a
            proposal for the membership or Local Council to vote on. If there’s
            a specific organizational need that falls outside the EOC/IOC
            frameworks (in the same way that Finance or the Secretary are
            necessarily council-level and independent), the Local Council can
            authorize the creation of an official Working Group by appointing
            two Co-Chairs, who will sit as nonvoting members on the Local
            Council.
