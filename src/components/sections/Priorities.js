            <P>The priorities resolution (PR) is a holistic document that outlines the political and organizational priorities for the chapter to undertake in the upcoming year.</P>

            <P>The "priority work areas" will name a political or organizational priority (e.g. "Labor," "Political Education," etc.) and then identify a strategy for working towards that goal, tactics that we might engage in, and coalition partners we want to collaborate with.</P>

            <P>The Steering Committee has approved a base PR document, which may be passed as is or amended at the convention on May 18. You can read the PR here.</P>
