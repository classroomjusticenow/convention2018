        <h2>Welcome to East Bay DSA. We’re glad you’re here.</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the fastest-growing socialist organization in the country.
          We need you (and two or more of your friends) to pitch in, show up,
          and drag a new world into being. There’s no time to lose, and
          everything to win.
        </p>

          The Democratic Socialists of America have our roots in the surges of
          socialist activity in the early 20th century, which at its peak had
          six-figure membership for the Socialist Party and hundreds of mayors
          and state legislators across the country. In 1982, a merger of Michael
          Harrington’s Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee with the New
          American Movement led to the creation of DSA, bringing together
          feminist, anti-Stalinist, and anti-imperialist currents from across
          the American Left. DSA is a “big tent”:{" "}
          <strong>
            we're a mass organization for everybody who wants to work together
            to win socialism.
          </strong>
        </p>

          In just the past year, national DSA membership has quadrupled to over
          30,000 members in all 50 states. Here in the East Bay, our active
          membership has grown even faster, as a dozen-strong
          donuts-and-conversation group suddenly took on hundreds of new
          members. The chapter as we know it (its structure, processes, and
          culture, right down to this handbook) were built by an all-volunteer
          force over the course of 2017. We’re figuring it out as we go, and as
          we all seek to understand and act in a new political context.

          We're a mix of experienced union and community organizers, newly
          minted socialists, and everyone in between. This guide is to help you
          get started. We've got a beautiful movement to build!
