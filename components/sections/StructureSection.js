        <h2>What’s the organizational structure of DSA?</h2>
        <p>
          DSA is a national confederation of local chapters. Every two years,
          chapters send delegates to a national convention. The delegates debate
          proposals, set priorities, and elect a 16-person body known as the
          National Political Council (NPC), which works to carry out the
          democratically determined priorities of the national organization over
          the following two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s worth noting that national priorities don’t mean we can’t have
          local efforts of our own, based on our particular geographic and
          political circumstances. National’s role is to support and encourage
          local chapters (where the life of the organization is), not to tell us
          what to do. At the same time, being a part of a national organization
          allows chapters to work together for the kind of big, ambitious wins
          against entrenched capitalist interests that could never be achieved
          without national coordination. A finger is weak, but a fist is strong.
        </p>
        <h3>Local structure</h3>
        <p>
          The following is a breezy paraphrase of the official bylaws for East
          Bay DSA, which can be found in full at{" "}
          <a href="http://eastbaydsa.org/resources-bylaws">
            eastbaydsa.org/resources-bylaws
          </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary bodies to keep track of are the{" "}
          <strong>General Membership</strong>, the
          <strong>Local Council</strong> (LC), the{" "}
          <strong>Internal Organizing Committee</strong> (IOC), and the
          <strong>External Organizing Committee</strong> (EOC).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>THE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP:</strong> That’s all of us. That’s
          where power rests ultimately. We do the work together, set priorities
          at our yearly convention, and gather every two months for General
          Meetings to vote on chapter business. Outside of official meetings,
          petitions that are signed by significant percentages of the membership
          (usually 10%) can trigger action. General Membership meetings are
          every other month; watch the website or the EBDSA newsletter for
          specific details.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Local Council</strong> (LC): The East Bay DSA Local
          Council serves as the democratically elected leadership of the Local
          and is the second-highest body after the General Membership. It
          manages the chapter’s day-today affairs, provides oversight, and
          resolves conflicts. It consists of thirteen elected members, who serve
          roughly one-year terms. If you’ve got a proposal for the LC, reach out
          to one of its members to workshop it and get it on the docket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Local Council has open meetings on the third Sunday of every
          month, unless several members can’t make it, in which case it’s
          sometimes (but rarely) rescheduled.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE INTERNAL ORGANIZING COMMITTEE (IOC): The Internal Organizing
          Committee focuses on the internal health of the organization. They
          focus on questions like, Are we encouraging a vibrant democratic
          culture? Do people feel like they know where to plug in? Are we
          providing pathways for people to build trust within the organization
          and further their political education? (They’re also in charge of
          recruitment and orientation for new members; this handbook, for
          instance, was the product of IOC work.) It’s also their responsibility
          to communicate with the membership about upcoming events and important
          local and national issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it’s time for a meeting of the General Membership, IOC handles
          the logistics and planning. The IOC consists of the three elected
          Internal Organizers and a number of appointed organizers to strengthen
          their capacities. If you’re ever feeling lost, Internal Organizers are
          good people to talk to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their projects and teams include <strong>Political Education</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>Mobilizers</strong> (a shop-steward style system for engaging
          individual members), and
          <strong>Social/Fundraising Events</strong>. The IOC meets the last
          Wednesday of every month to bring in new organizers to help build our
          organization.
        </p>
        <SideBar title="Who is the local council?" style="red">
          <p>
            The Council consists of 13 elected (voting) members, for good luck.
            These are:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Two Co-Chairs:</strong> Co-Chairs organize and preside over
            meetings of the Council. They also act as “executive officers” when
            the situation requires it: acting as official spokespeople, putting
            their names on financial documents, and managing communications with
            National or other chapters.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>One Vice-Chair:</strong> The Vice-Chair assists the
            Co-Chairs with their duties and fills in if either of the Co-Chairs
            aren’t able to fulfil their duties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>One Secretary:</strong> The secretary takes notes and makes
            sure that minutes of all General Membership and LC meetings are
            freely available, along with any other outputs of meetings. They
            manage the institutional knowledge of the Local.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>One Treasurer:</strong> The Treasurer is responsible for
            dealing with all that dirty, dirty money: fundraising, budgeting,
            expenditures, and keeping the financial ship in order. They keep
            transparent and open finances, periodically reported out.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Three Elected Internal Organizers:</strong> Internal
            Organizers are responsible for fostering a lively participatory
            democratic culture, and making sure no one falls through the cracks.
            They oversee the Internal Organizing Committee (IOC) and head up
            internally focused events, fundraisers, and educational efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Three Elected External Organizers:</strong> External
            Organizers oversee the External Organizing Committee (EOC) and are
            responsible for outward facing efforts like electoral campaigns,
            direct actions, rallies, and otherwise propagandizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Two At-Large Council Members:</strong> They’re sort of like
            “ministers without portfolio” in the UK. Because they’re not tasked
            with specific roles, they can think a bit more deeply about Local
            Council decision-making and can speak for the membership as their
            main focus.
          </p>
        </SideBar>
        <p>
          <strong>THE EXTERNAL ORGANIZING COMMITTEE (EOC):</strong> The External
          Organizing Committee focuses on the fight for socialism in the East
          Bay and beyond, including campaigns, actions, and publicity. When the
          General Membership determines priorities and the Local Council turns
          them into plans, it’s the role of the EOC to execute on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The questions they focus on will change depending on outside cir-
          cumstances and EBDSA priorities, but currently include things like,
          How do we build power in these circumstances? Who’s tabling at First
          Friday? How can we help people wake up to their power? Which electoral
          candidates are open to a socialist vision and how vocal are they about
          it? How many comrades will we have marching in the streets on
          Saturday?
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the IOC, the EOC consists of three elected External Organizers
          and a number of appointed organizers. If an effort is focused on the
          general public or the “outside world,” it probably involves EOC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their projects and teams include <strong>Direct Action</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>District Canvassing</strong>
          (currently focused on Single-Payer), and (for efforts approved by the
          General Membership) <strong>Electoral</strong> work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EOC meets the last Tuesday of every month to bring new organizers
          into our public-facing political campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</strong>, the org looks like this
          (though the exact projects and groups within the IOC and EOC will be
          subject to change).
